# Master Ontology Reference (FAQ-Aligned)

This ontology defines how FAQ-style CSV data should be mapped into a Knowledge Graph. It is intended as a **guiding reference**, not a rigid or exhaustive schema. Agents should extract **all explicitly supported information**, without inventing or forcing attributes.

Entities or attributes not listed here are **out of scope** and MUST NOT be introduced.

---

## Global Extraction Rules

* Extract information **only if explicitly stated** in the Question or Answer text
* Do NOT guess, infer, or normalize beyond what is written
* Do NOT drop valid information simply because it feels sparse
* Multiple attributes of the same type may exist if explicitly supported
* Verbatim evidence is mandatory for all extracted facts

---

## Entity Definitions & Attributes

### CustomerIntent

Represents the customer’s expressed goal, question, or desired outcome.

**Attributes:**

* `intent_text` — verbatim Question text or explicit goal phrase
* `intent_context` — any explicit situational qualifier (e.g., lease-end, early termination)

---

### InstructionStep

Represents an action or procedural step the customer is instructed to perform.

**Attributes:**

* `action_text` — verbatim action phrase
* `action_object` — entity the action applies to (vehicle, form, account)
* `instruction_context` — conditions or circumstances tied to the step
* `reference_material` — guide, page, or link explicitly mentioned

---

### Condition

Represents an explicit rule, prerequisite, or conditional statement.

**Attributes:**

* `condition_text` — full verbatim conditional statement
* `condition_scope` — what the condition applies to, if stated

---

### EvidenceAnchor

Represents verbatim textual evidence supporting any extracted fact.

**Attributes:**

* `quoted_text` — exact substring from Question or Answer

---

### Requirement

Represents something the customer must provide, complete, or satisfy.

**Attributes:**

* `requirement_text` — verbatim description of the requirement
* `requirement_context` — when or why it is required, if stated

---

### Outcome

Represents an explicitly stated result or consequence.

**Attributes:**

* `outcome_text` — verbatim outcome description
* `outcome_trigger` — condition or action that causes the outcome, if stated

---

### Constraint

Represents an explicit limitation or restriction.

**Attributes:**

* `constraint_text` — verbatim limitation or restriction

---

### Tool

Represents a system, document, form, or guide referenced in the FAQ.

**Attributes:**

* `tool_name` — explicit name of the tool or resource
* `tool_access` — how it is accessed (link, portal, dealer)

---

### Location

Represents a physical or organizational place.

**Attributes:**

* `location_name` — explicit location name
* `location_type` — dealer, service center, authorized location, etc.

---

### Policy

Represents an explicit company or program rule.

**Attributes:**

* `policy_text` — verbatim policy statement
* `policy_scope` — what the policy governs, if stated

---

### Exception

Represents an explicit deviation from a rule or policy.

**Attributes:**

* `exception_text` — verbatim exception statement

---

### Clarification

Represents explanatory or disambiguating information.

**Attributes:**

* `clarification_text` — verbatim explanatory text

---

## Relationship Guidance

Relationships should be created **only when logically and textually supported**.

Common relationship types include:

* `FULFILLS` (InstructionStep → CustomerIntent)
* `REQUIRES` (InstructionStep → Requirement)
* `APPLIES_WHEN` (Condition → InstructionStep or Outcome)
* `RESULTS_IN` (InstructionStep or Condition → Outcome)
* `REFERENCES` (InstructionStep → Tool)
* `LOCATED_AT` (InstructionStep → Location)
* `GOVERNED_BY` (InstructionStep or Outcome → Policy)
* `EXCEPTED_BY` (Policy → Exception)

Do NOT create relationships based on ordering, assumptions, or domain knowledge.

## Final Notes for Agents

* This file is a **reference framework**, not a constraint to over-engineer
* Extract **all explicitly stated information**, even if uneven across rows
* Sparse nodes are valid if the source text is sparse
* When uncertain, prefer omission over interpretation
